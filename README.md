# DevSecOps
DevSecOps is an essential methodology that integrates security practices into the DevOps process, emphasizing the need to consider security at every stage of the software development lifecycle. This approach ensures that security is not an afterthought but a continuous, integral part of the development and operations pipeline. 

# Origins of DevOps!

When the code reaches the server, it breaks. The development team reports that their application is not functioning correctly, while the operations team insists that the servers are running smoothly.

From the developers' perspective, the code was working perfectly, but the operations team denies any responsibility, claiming it's not their issue. This discrepancy leads to a debate over who is at fault.

To resolve this conflict and bridge the gap between the two teams, DevOps emerged. By automating processes and fostering collaboration, DevOps ensures that the code works consistently across both development and operations environments, eliminating these types of disputes.
